# Python-app
This Python program determines which of the two input numbers is greater and then informs the user about which number is larger. Here's a description of the program and how to use it:

# Description:

1. The program starts by printing a message that explains its purpose, which is to find out which of the two input numbers is greater. <br>
2. It then prompts the user to enter two integer values, 'a' and 'b', using the input function, and converts these inputs into integers using int(). <br>
3. The program uses an if statement to compare 'a' and 'b' to determine which one is greater.<br>
<blockquote>
*   If 'a' is greater than 'b', it prints "a son katta -" followed by the value of 'a'.
*   If 'b' is greater than 'a', it prints "b son katta -" followed by the value of 'b'.
*   If 'a' and 'b' are equal, it does not enter either branch of the if statement.
</blockquote>
4. The program displays the result to the user.
# How to Use:

1. Run the program typing with: <br>
```
python test.py
```
2. Enter an integer value for 'a' when prompted.
3. Enter another integer value for 'b' when prompted.
4. The program will compare 'a' and 'b' and then display a message indicating which number is larger. For example, if you enter 'a' as 5 and 'b' as 3, the program will display "a son katta - 5" because 'a' is greater than 'b'.
